# Modus-Vivendi-VSCode

This theme was inspired by one of the themes from Emacs, which is the Original Modus-Vivendi theme created by [Protesilaos Stavrou](https://github.com/protesilaos)

A big thanks to [Ronnie](https://github.com/ronniedroid) who started creating this theme for Visual Studio Code, you can find the original Modus-Vivendi theme for Visual Studo code created by him on his profile:

This theme is our best effort to replicate his theme from emacs and is not perfect. This theme is now available on the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.
