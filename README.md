# Modus-Vivendi-VSCode
## This is the README for your theme extension "modus-vivendi" for Visual Studio Code

This theme was inspired by one of the themes from Emacs, which is the Original Modus-Vivendi theme created by [Protesilaos Stavrou](https://github.com/protesilaos)

[Original Modus-Vivendi Themes](https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes/)

A big thanks to [Ronnie](https://github.com/ronniedroid) who started creating this theme for Visual Studio Code, you can find the original Modus-Vivendi theme for Visual Studo code created by him on his profile:

This theme is our best effort to replicate his theme from emacs and is not perfect. This theme is still yet to be published, and be available on the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.

**Enjoy!**
